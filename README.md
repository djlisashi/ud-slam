# Project 3 of the Computer Vision Nanodegree from Udacity
## Landmark Detection & Robot Tracking (SLAM)

This project is an implementation of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world. We can create a map of the environment of the robot through the combination of motion and sensor data that was gathered over time. 


## Example
Below you can see an example of  a 50 x 50 grid world with with landmarks (purple x's) and robot position (a red 'o') lcreated by using only sensor and motion data collected from the robot. <br>

## Implementation
The project consists of three Python notebooks and the implementation of the robot class in robot_class.py.

**- Notebook 1:** Robot Moving and Sensing<br>
**- Notebook 2:** Omega and Xi, Constraints<br>
**- Notebook 3:** Landmark Detection and Tracking<br>
